-MiniMashUp
	This part of the project includes the files mashupHTML, mashupCSS, mashupJS (which is all the code we wrote) as well as lastfm.api, lastfm.api.cahce, and lastfm.api.md5 which was written by github user fxb and allow for easier calls to lastfm's api within javascript. His code is freely available for download and use. This mashup allows a user to enter a musical artist and then it plots the artists upcoming concerts on google maps with additional details available upon clicking the markers. Documentation is within the files themselves and testing is in the file called MashUpTesting.
