Personal_Projects
=================

These are school projects that showcase the kind of work that I currently enjoy.

So far the projects include...

1. Concert Tracker
  * A browser based web application that utilizes Last.fm and google maps APIs with some javascript to allow users to search for a musical artist which shows their upcoming concert itinerary on a world map.
2. Javascript Tic Tac Toe
  * Exactly what it sounds like. Not pretty but it works.
3. Online Grocery
  * A Ruby on Rails project accomplished with a group at school. Followed the example by The Pragmatic Programmers' *Agile Web Development with Rails 4*. Could use some more work but could be a good starting point for an E-commerce site.
